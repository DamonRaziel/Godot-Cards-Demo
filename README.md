# Godot Cards Demo

A simple base for card games.

Created and shared as I couldn't find any others like it for Godot a while back.

Based on a python script I found while searching, and rebuilt using GDScript. The python script is included in the scripts.

At the moment there are three game types; single hand 5 card stud, 5 card stud with 4 rounds and betting, and hold 'em with rounds and betting.
